# ðŸ”§ Arduino Projects â€” Mechanical Engineering Intro Lab

This repository contains Arduino code and documentation from my introductory mechanical engineering lab course. These projects were completed as part of a hands-on curriculum designed to build foundational skills in electronics, programming, and system integration.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Each file in this repository corresponds to a lab activity or experiment involving microcontroller-based systems. The projects demonstrate key concepts such as:

- Digital and analog I/O
- Sensor integration and data acquisition
- Actuator control (e.g., LEDs)
- Serial communication and debugging
- Basic automation and logic implementation

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Arduino Uno** (or equivalent board)
- **Arduino IDE**
- Common components: resistors, LEDs, potentiometers, push buttons

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These files were written independently as part of my personal learning and lab assignments. They reflect my growing proficiency in embedded systems and my ability to translate mechanical engineering principles into functional code.

## ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes

Through these labs, I gained experience in:

- Writing and debugging embedded code
- Interfacing hardware components with microcontrollers
- Applying engineering logic to real-world systems
- Documenting technical work for reproducibility and clarity

Let me know if you'd like to add images, wiring diagrams, or links to lab instructions. I can also help you write a short project summary for each file if you're planning to showcase this work.
