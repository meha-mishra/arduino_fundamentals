# ðŸ”§ Arduino Projects â€” Mechanical Engineering Intro Lab

This repository contains Arduino code and documentation from my introductory mechanical engineering lab course. These projects were completed as part of a hands-on curriculum designed to build foundational skills in electronics, programming, and system integration.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Each file in this repository corresponds to a lab activity or experiment involving microcontroller-based systems. The projects demonstrate key concepts such as:

- Digital and analog I/O
- Sensor integration and data acquisition
- Actuator control (e.g., LEDs)
- Serial communication and debugging
- Basic automation and logic implementation

## File Specific Programs
- led_blink: make an LED blink at a certain frequency
- led_button: make an LED blink at the push of a button
- pot_serial: connect the data from a potentiometer to a serial plotter
- led_dim_lab: make an LED turn on, off, or a variable dim setting according to input from a button and a potentiometer
- LineDetecting: make an IR sensor detect a black line and correspond its orientation (left/middle/right sensor) to an LED
- UltrasonicServo: connect a Servo motor to an ultrasonic sensor to detect an object up to 30 cm away

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Arduino Uno** (or equivalent board)
- **Arduino IDE**
- Common components: resistors, LEDs, potentiometers, push buttons

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These files were written independently as part of my personal learning and lab assignments. They reflect my growing proficiency in embedded systems and my ability to translate mechanical engineering principles into functional code.

## ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes

Through these labs, I gained experience in:

- Writing and debugging embedded code
- Interfacing hardware components with microcontrollers
- Applying engineering logic to real-world systems
- Documenting technical work for reproducibility and clarity
